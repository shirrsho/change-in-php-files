# CWSlack-SlashCommands

This script, when hosted on a PHP supported web server, will act as a bridge between the JSON requests of Slack and the JSON responses of the ConnectWise REST API.

cwslack.php, cwslack-incoming.php, cwslack-activities.php, cwslack-configs.php, and cwslack-contacts.php were designed to be independent, but all rely on the config.php and functions.php files. This allows you to pick and choose what you want and for different Slack commands instead of one universal /cw tickets 249123 and /cw contact john doe it can be /t 249123 and /c john doe.

#### Note: This project is currently being maintained for bugs only, all further new feature development is being done on the hosted successor at https://mspic.io

#### Note: As of July 2019, you need a Client ID to use any public integrations with the ConnectWise APIs. You'll need to sign up for a developer account at https://developer.connectwise.com and you can then generate a Client ID which goes into config.php as $cwClientId. This does not apply to hosted integrations such as mspIC, as that is handled by the host. Generate your ID here: https://developer.connectwise.com/ClientID

# Installation Instructions

This script set and all modules require PHP version 5 and the cURL extension, and many require a MySQL or MariaDB server.

For unsupported non-MySQL installation instructions, please see README_NoMySQL.md

**See TROUBLESHOOT.md first if you have any issues. Otherwise, contact info below.**

You can reach me on the r/msp Discord, LabTechGeek Slack, or via reddit at /u/jundis if you need basic support.

You can also reach me at joey(at)und.is should you need more intense support, custom modifications, or want your install done by me.

#### Update Instructions

Use the scripts found in the updates folder to upgrade from an older version to current. This will automatically update the config.php file with necessary values and create any new MySQL tables as well. You can also manually update by comparing the config file from this repository to your active one.
